            In the future, we envision you, Yui and the car working together—like teammates. Now, here comes the really fun part. Thanks to the car's advanced automated driving technologies, people with all levels of ability can enjoy the ride. You're still in charge of the car. However, through biometric sensors throughout the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. That information then gets analyzed by the car's AI. That's when the automated features kick in.
